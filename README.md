# Juistini - Just in time info at your doorstep
WIP. E-paper info board with different information that could be useful for when entering or exiting your home.

Building on [Waveshare e-paper](https://github.com/waveshare/e-Paper) and [Raspberry Pi Zero W](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/), but should be created to work with other screens and Linux computers as well. So I guess the push of images to the screen should only be described, but not be a part of this module.
